Data Contents

The dataset which will be analysed contains information on movies released between 1960 and 2015. Each entry specifies the cast, genre and representative keywords as well as financial information related to the budget and revenue earned. Furthermore there is also data on the popularity of the movie and the number of votes received from viewers.

Objectives 

The analysis will be done on two directions to reflect the perspective of both viewers and movie producers: ratings and earnings.

Ratings 

From a viewer perspective we aim to see the highest rated movies per genre as well as the actors most oftenly playing in critically acclaimed films. Moreover, we will also be looking at the most frequent keywords per decade to get an idea of how the film characteristics have evolved over time. Finally we will be doing a cross reference of the charts based on ratings and earnings to see if the films and actors are common in the two.

Earnings 

The second part of the analysis will be focused on the financial results of the movies in the set. We will start by seeing the charts of the best earners per genre. Next, a breakdown will be done by multiple categories to see what are the characteristics of the most profitable films (e.g. actors, genres). We will close down by looking at the evolution of profits in the industry over time and see which time periods were the most successful in terms of earnings.
